Project Title: Maze Game

Brief description: 

This is a single player game in which the player moves from the starting position through the maze to reach the end goal. 
The optimal route (found by dynamic programming) and the player’s route will be displayed at the end of each game, so the 
user can see how close they were to finding the shortest path. There will be an easy, medium, and hard level, and each time 
you play the maze will be different than the last.

The demonstration will be the implementation of this game.  The user will control the player's movement by the arrow keys 
on the keyboard.

Milestones:
1) Develop a maze-generating algorithm.  For milestone 1, this need only work for easy-level mazes.  The mazes generated
will have exactly 1 possible solution (i.e. to travel from the start to the end of the maze, the user must pass a unique 
sequence of waypoints), with a minimum path length from start to finish.  The mazes will be randomly generated, so a 
different maze with a unique solution is created each time the game is played.
(complete by March 25th - this will be the largest milestone)

2) Expand maze generation to have more complicated medium-level mazes and still more-complicated hard-level mazes 
(always randomly generated and with one solution). 
(complete by March 29th)

3) Create a keyboard-controlled object that that the user moves around the maze from start to finish. 
(complete by April 1st)

4) Track the path the user’s icon moves from leaving its start point to reaching its end point.  At the end of the 
game, plot the user’s path on the map in one colour and the optimal path in a different colour, so the user can see 
how close they were to the best solution. 
(complete by April 5th)

5) Implement a menu that the user can use to generate a new maze or select a different difficulty level. 
(complete by April 8th, 1 day before Demo Date)
